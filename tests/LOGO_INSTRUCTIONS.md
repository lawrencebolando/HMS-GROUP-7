# Logo Instructions

## Logo File Location
The logo SVG file has been created at: `public/images/logo.svg`

## To Use Your Actual Logo

If you have the actual logo image file (PNG, JPG, or SVG), follow these steps:

1. **Replace the logo file:**
   - Place your logo file in: `public/images/logo.png` (or `.jpg`, `.svg`)
   - Make sure it's named `logo.png`, `logo.jpg`, or `logo.svg`

2. **Update the image references** (if using a different format):
   - If your logo is PNG or JPG, change `.svg` to `.png` or `.jpg` in:
     - `app/Views/login.php`
     - `app/Views/home.php`
     - `app/Views/templates/dashboard_layout.php`
